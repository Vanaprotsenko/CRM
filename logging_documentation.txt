# Documentation on the logsystem

## 1. Configuring the Logins

The logsystem in this project is configured using the standard Python library, 'logging'. The configuration is as follows:

`python
import logging

# Configuration of the Logins
logging.basicConfig(
    filename='app.log',  # File to write the logs to
    level=logging.INFO,  # Minimum level of messages to be written
    format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s'  # Record Format
)

2. Loglevels and their assignment
The logsystem uses the following levels:

DEBUG: Detailed information useful for diagnostics.
INFO: Information messages about the normal operation of the application.
WARNING: Notifications of potential problems.
ERROR: Error messages that prevent the application from running.

%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s
asctime: The time and date when the record was recorded.
